A repo created specifically for tasks implementation's from #Js30Challenge https://javascript30.com/
The idea of the repo - to make funny taks and improve VanillaJS knowledge.

At the moment all tasks from "30 day js challenge" was done. Some of this task was done by my own, just with idea of a task gotten from javascript30, some of them was done with help from the js30 course videos.
